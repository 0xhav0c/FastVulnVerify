FastVulnVerify is an advanced Python tool developed to quickly identify common vulnerabilities encountered during penetration testing and vulnerability verification processes. This script offers a modular framework that allows you to rapidly detect and verify vulnerabilities in system and network infrastructures. By automating vulnerability tests on IP addresses and ports based on various attack vectors, it minimizes the time lost in manual processes.

This tool was developed around two years ago to eliminate the time wasted in the repetitive manual verification of common vulnerabilities. At that time, it was a frequent hassle to constantly check notes, cheat sheets, and various resources while manually verifying potential vulnerabilities detected by tools like Nessus. The reason I didn't share this tool back then was my concern about Penetration Testers losing their technical skills. However, today, by sharing this script, my goal is to accelerate pentesting processes and enable security professionals to dedicate more time to research.

## Who need this

- Penetration Testers
- Bug Hunters

## Features

- Module-Based Scanning: The script supports various test modules, allowing you to select and run them for quick and efficient scans.
- Streamlined Output: Unnecessary outputs are trimmed, making it easier to capture clean screenshots.
- Over 100 Modules
